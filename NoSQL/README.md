NoSQL stands for "Not Only SQL" or "Non-Relational." It is a broad category of database management systems that are designed to handle diverse and large volumes of unstructured, semi-structured, or structured data. Unlike traditional relational databases that use a fixed schema and are primarily SQL-based, NoSQL databases provide a more flexible data model and support various data models, including document-oriented, key-value pairs, column-family, and graph databases.

The term "NoSQL" does not imply a lack of SQL-like query languages entirely; rather, it signifies a departure from the rigid structure of traditional relational databases and the adoption of more scalable and flexible approaches to data storage and retrieval. NoSQL databases are often chosen for applications where data requirements are not well-suited to the tabular, structured format of SQL databases.
