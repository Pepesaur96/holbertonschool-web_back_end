## Defining a Class:

In JavaScript (including ES6), you can define a class using the class keyword. Here's a basic example:

    class Animal {
    constructor(name, sound) {
        this.name = name;
        this.sound = sound;
    }

    makeSound() {
        console.log(`${this.name} says ${this.sound}`);
    }
    }

## Adding Methods to a Class:

You can add methods to a class by defining them inside the class body. In the example above, makeSound is a method of the Animal class.

## Adding a Static Method to a Class:

Static methods are methods that belong to the class itself rather than instances of the class. You can add a static method using the static keyword:

    class Animal {
    // ... constructor and other methods ...

    static getClassName() {
    return "Animal";
    }
    }

    console.log(Animal.getClassName()); // Outputs: "Animal"

Static methods are called on the class, not on instances of the class.

## Extending a Class:

You can create a subclass that inherits from another class using the extends keyword:

    class Dog extends Animal {
    constructor(name, breed) {
    super(name, "bark"); // Call the constructor of the superclass
    this.breed = breed;
    }

    // Additional methods specific to Dog can be added here
    }

In this example, Dog is a subclass of Animal, and it inherits the properties and methods of Animal. The super keyword is used to call the constructor of the superclass.

## Metaprogramming and Symbols:

Metaprogramming involves writing code that manipulates code at runtime. Symbols are a primitive data type introduced in ES6 that can be used for metaprogramming.

A symbol is a unique and immutable data type. You can use symbols as keys for object properties, which makes them useful for creating private or hidden properties in classes:

const mySymbol = Symbol("description");

    class MyClass {
    constructor() {
    this[mySymbol] = "Hidden Property";
    }

    getHiddenProperty() {
    return this[mySymbol];
    }
    }

In this example, mySymbol is a symbol used as a key for a property in MyClass. This property is not easily discoverable from outside the class, providing a form of encapsulation.

Metaprogramming with symbols allows for more sophisticated behaviors, such as creating custom iterators, modifying object behavior, etc. However, it requires a good understanding of JavaScript's reflective capabilities and is generally considered advanced usage.
