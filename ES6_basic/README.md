ES6, or ECMAScript 2015, is the sixth edition of the ECMAScript standard, which is the specification that JavaScript is based on. ES6 introduced several new features and enhancements to the language, aiming to make JavaScript more expressive, concise, and powerful. Here are some key features introduced in ES6:

1. Let and Const Declarations:

- `let` allows the declaration of block-scoped variables.
- `const` is used to declare constants, whose values cannot be reassigned.

2. Arrow Functions:

- Arrow functions provide a concise syntax for writing anonymous functions.
- They do not have their own `this` context, making them suitable for certain use cases.

3. Default Parameters:

- Functions can now have default parameter values, reducing the need for boilerplate code.

4. Rest and Spread Operators:

- The rest parameter (`...rest`) allows functions to accept a variable number of arguments as an array.
- The spread operator (`...`) can be used to spread elements of an array or object into another array or object.

5. Template Literals:

- String templating allows the embedding of expressions inside string literals using backticks (`).

6. Object Destructuring:

- Object destructuring allows for the extraction of values from objects into distinct variables in a concise manner.

7. Classes:

- ES6 introduced class syntax for creating objects with a more familiar and structured syntax.

8. Modules:

- Modules provide a way to organize code into reusable and maintainable units.

9. Iterators and for-of Loops:

- Iterators allow custom objects to define their iteration behavior.
- The `for-of` loop simplifies iteration over iterable objects like arrays and strings.

These features collectively improve the readability, maintainability, and expressiveness of JavaScript code.

Regarding your question about the difference between a constant and a variable:

- A variable is a container for storing data values, and its value can be changed during the execution of a program using the assignment operator (`=`).
- A constant, declared using the `const` keyword in ES6, is a variable that cannot be reassigned once it has been assigned a value. It is block-scoped like `let` but has a fixed value.

Block-scoped variables mean that the scope of the variable is limited to the block, statement, or expression where it is defined. This is in contrast to `var` declarations, which are function-scoped and can lead to unexpected behavior.
